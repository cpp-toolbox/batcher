# batcher
a class which helps manage batching over shaders, note that there are no source files stored, but instead must be generated with the python script.

## setup
1. the batcher reles on the shader standard project and you must link in `shader_standard.py` and `standard.py` in to this directory for it to operate correctly
2. run `batcher.py` and generate the shaders you need
